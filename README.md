# why-and-how

Don't ask why I'm doing it, I'm just here to figure out how.

This is intended to be a web application, probably just rendering and displaying mock data, but it's all going to be done with absolutely zero framework help.

I guess you could say it's all written in [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/).
